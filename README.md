#### Introduction
As financial markets continue to evolve, exchange traded funds and notes have become increasingly popular amongst retail and institutional investors as a method of easily generating exposure to certain asset groups. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are pooled investment securities that are often used to track the performance of anything from equity and debt instruments to entire industry sectors. Similar to ETFs, exchange traded notes (ETNs) are unsecured debt securities that are not backed by physical assets but are still used to track securities; while similar in structure to other debt instruments like bonds, ETNs do not pay interest - a feature that allows it to be traded on major stock exchanges.
Because of the liqudity advantage that ETFs and ETNs provide to investors, the products themselves have become ubiquitous in global markets. For example, commodity-backed ETFs and ETNs are simpler to access and manage when compared to directly investing in commodities futures contracts. As a result of this, conducting predictive and prescriptive analyses on the exchange-traded products can provide valuable insights into trends in complex commodity markets.
